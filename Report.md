# Police Incident Data Analysis Project Report

## 1. Introduction

This project aims to analyze police incident data using a structured ETL pipeline, which integrates multiple technologies for data extraction, transformation, and visualization. The primary objective is to identify trends, spot anomalies, and forecast future incidents to support strategic planning and resource allocation.

## 2. Project Pipeline

### 2.1 Data Collection and Orchestration
- **Source**: Police incident data is downloaded through a public API.
- **Orchestration Tool**: Mage AI automates the ETL pipeline, fetching data at scheduled intervals and orchestrating the data pipeline to minimize manual interventions.

### 2.2 Database and Storage
- **Database**: Data is stored in a PostgreSQL database running on Docker for easy management.
- **Database Interface**: PgAdmin provides a user-friendly interface for database management and query execution.

### 2.3 Data Transformation
- **Tool**: dbt (Data Build Tool) handles the transformation tasks, cleaning and structuring the data into various fact and dimension tables.
- **Views Created**: Key views generated include:
  - `fact_incidents`: A fact table detailing individual incidents.
  - `dim_resolution`, `dim_location`, `dim_date`, `dim_incident_type`: Dimension tables for additional incident metadata.
  - `agg_incident_trends`, `agg_incident_trends_2023`: Aggregated views for analyzing yearly trends.
  - `all_records`: A consolidated view for comprehensive analysis.

### 2.4 Data Analysis and Forecasting
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Analysis and forecasting are conducted in Jupyter Notebook, utilizing Python libraries for visualization and forecasting.
- **Forecasting Tool**: Prophet is used for time-series forecasting to predict incident trends over the upcoming months.

## 3. Analysis Insights

### 3.1 Data Summary
- **Data Range**: The dataset covers police incidents across multiple years but analysis was focused on 2023 only.
- **Key Fields Analyzed**: Incident date, type, resolution, and geographic information.

### 3.2 Incident Trends
- **Findings**: The analysis identified recurring seasonal trends and some spikes in incident counts for certain categories, such as "Larceny Theft" in specific months.
- **Visualization**: Line plots and trend analysis highlighted fluctuations across different incident types, particularly noting an unusual spike in March.

### 3.3 Anomaly Detection and Forecasting
- **Anomalies**: Detected unusual spikes in March, prompting further investigation.
- **Forecasting**: Using Prophet, future trends were forecasted, showing projected incident counts for upcoming months. This forecasting provides insights into expected incident volumes, helping police departments plan resources accordingly.

## 4. Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrates the use of a structured data pipeline to manage and analyze police incident data. With tools like Mage AI, dbt, PostgreSQL, and Jupyter Notebook, the pipeline efficiently ingests, transforms, and visualizes data for valuable insights.

**Future Work**:
- Expand anomaly detection to identify other patterns.
- Build an interactive dashboard for real-time updates and insights.
- Implement automated alerts for unusual spikes in incident counts.
